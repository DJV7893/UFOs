## Overview

### Purpose:

  For Dana, a data journalist, we built a table using UFO Sighting data that included countries, cities, states, and type of sighting stored in a JavaScript array. We then created a filter based on date to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. To make the webpage more interactive and aesthetically pleasing we customized the HTML file using Bootstrap and equipped the table with fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. After completing the initial setup of the UFO sighting webpage, Dana has requested that we provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, weâ€™ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary

### Recommendations:

  The biggest drawback for users when interacting with the updated UFO Sightings table is the lack of accessibility to the parameters available for each filter. If we were to filter based on UFO sighting shape we would have to scroll through the initialized page in order to gauge what shape parameters were available to enter. In order to fix this issue we could create a drop-down list for each of the input fields where a user could click on an input field and select the desired parameter and the table would then refresh. Furthermore, to help expedite the process when wanting to reset input fields we can include a clear filter button that would be located below the Shape input field.
